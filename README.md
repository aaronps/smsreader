# SMSReader for android

This is an old project I did to study what data was stored on my Samsung Galaxy
S2 (i9100). Not all the functions are finished, but you can see what data is are
stored with the SMS, each different phone may have some extra values stored.

The export/import functions were never done.

The code stays for historical purposes.
